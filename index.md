## About Me

My name is Vincent Ingram, and I am thrilled to share my journey and research project with you. Currently, I am enrolled at Morgan State University, pursuing a Computer Science degree. I am expected to graduate in 2024. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong interest in Virtual Reality and Mobile App Development. I am dedicated to exploring innovative solutions and contributing to knowledge advancement in different fields.

If you have questions or would like to contact me, please feel free to reach out via email at vinceingram7@gmail.com.

## About My Mentor

I am fortunate to have Chris Crawford's guidance and mentorship. He is an accomplished Computer Science researcher affiliated with The University of Alabama. Dr. Crawford brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to our collaboration, and their guidance has been invaluable in shaping my research project.

## About My Project

- Problem: There is a lack of research focusing on exploring ways to build educational software that integrates physical robots and physiological sensors.
- Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:
 - Capture physiological data such as EEG and EMG from the human body.
 - Process raw sensor data and classify events such as gestures (e.g., arm movements) and emotional states (e.g., attention levels)
 - Map output from physiological sensors to a physical robot.
- Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the REU program. The poster will focus on the systemâ€™s technical architecture.
