title: Week 4 - Embracing Challenges and Expanding Horizons

In the fourth week of our DREU journey, the path led us to new challenges that stretched our capabilities and tested our problem-solving skills. Having conquered the PID system and witnessed our mBot Neo following the wall with elegance, we were met with a task that took us into the realm of open-source programming.

## A Triumph of Innovation

The success of our PID system was a cause for celebration. Our mentor's delight and approval were truly rewarding, affirming the progress we had made in understanding and implementing intricate robotic systems. The mBot Neo had transformed from a collection of parts to an autonomous follower, a testament to our dedication and perseverance.

## Expanding Horizons: Venturing into Open Source

As a testament to our growing proficiency, our mentor entrusted us with a new challenge: using the mBot Neo in an open-source environment. The task was to break away from the familiarity of mBlock IDE and explore programming the robot in a different coding environment. We chose Visual Studio Code (VSCode) due to our familiarity with its interface and features.

## Navigating the Unfamiliar

The transition to VSCode was not without its hurdles. The most significant challenge was navigating the landscape of documentation and resources for the mBot open-source project. We quickly discovered that finding comprehensive and well-structured guidance was easier said than done. The complexity of the open-source environment demanded a fresh approach to learning and problem-solving.

## A Week of Persistence

The week became a journey of trial and error, a dance between coding and troubleshooting. Each line of code, every debugging attempt, was a step toward unraveling the open-source potential of the mBot Neo. While the week neared its end without the complete success we had hoped for, the experience taught us invaluable lessons in adaptability, resourcefulness, and the unpredictable nature of research.

## The Ongoing Odyssey

Week 4 highlighted the essence of research: the willingness to explore uncharted territories, to face challenges head-on, and to adapt to new technologies and methodologies. Our exploration of open-source programming with the mBot Neo is far from over. The obstacles we encountered only add to our determination to master this new aspect of robotics.

Stay tuned as we continue to navigate the world of open source, uncovering its potential, and embarking on a journey of continuous learning and growth.
