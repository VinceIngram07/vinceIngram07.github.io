Week 7 - Navigating the Intricacies of EDA Data

The seventh week of our DREU expedition introduced us to a new realm of data intricacies and challenges. Our mission, to establish a bridge between human physiological responses and robotic action, delved deep into the world of EDA (Electrodermal Activity) data collected through the EmotiBit. While progress had been our constant companion, this week's journey brought with it unforeseen hurdles that tested our problem-solving skills.

## Processing EDA Data

As the EmotiBit became our window into the realm of human physiological responses, we focused on processing the EDA data using Python. We developed a program that effectively collected and stored the data in real time, allowing us to visualize the physiological cues as they were being recorded. Our hope was to leverage this data to create a semi-autonomous interaction between the human and the mBot Neo.

## An Unexpected Glitch

While the program effectively handled the PPG (Photoplethysmogram) data, the EDA data presented an unexpected challenge. Instead of providing a continuous stream of data, the EDA data only updated intermittently, often with intervals of around 30 seconds. This anomaly perplexed us, as EDA data held significant promise due to its reliability and potential for real-time human-robot interaction.

## Seeking Solutions

Week 7 became a quest for answers. We delved into the intricacies of the EmotiBit's EDA data capture, exploring potential causes for the intermittent updates. Our determination led us to experiment with various approaches, hoping to identify a solution that would ensure continuous and accurate EDA data transmission.

## A Yet Unsolved Puzzle

Despite our best efforts, the issue with EDA data updating remained unsolved by the end of Week 7. The nature of research is often unpredictable, throwing challenges that require meticulous investigation and creative problem-solving. Our pursuit of creating a seamless interaction between human physiological responses and robotic action faced a roadblock, but our spirits remained undaunted.

## The Unpredictable Path

Week 7 illuminated a fundamental aspect of research - the unpredictability of the journey. The quest for knowledge, innovation, and discovery is not a linear path, but a series of twists and turns that test our adaptability and perseverance. As we navigate the complexities of EDA data, we are reminded that it is in overcoming challenges that true growth occurs.

## The Road Ahead

As we reflect on the challenges of Week 7, we look forward with determination. Our mission to create a semi-autonomous interaction remains intact. We are resolute in our pursuit of understanding the nuances of EDA data transmission and leveraging its potential for seamless human-robot interaction.

Stay tuned as we continue to unravel the mysteries of EDA data, surmount obstacles, and pave the way for innovation in the realm of human-robot interaction.
