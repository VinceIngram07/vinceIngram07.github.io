title: Week 2 - Unveiling the mBot Neo and Exploring Robotics

This week marked an exciting step forward in our DREU journey as my fellow REU student and I were introduced to a fascinating robotic companion: the mBot Neo by mBlock. The mere prospect of working with a robot was enough to ignite our curiosity and enthusiasm. Little did we know that the journey ahead would be a perfect blend of assembling, coding, and problem-solving.

## Building Blocks of Innovation

The moment the mBot Neo was placed before us, we couldn't help but marvel at its potential. The assembly process was akin to a robotic version of constructing with metal Legos. Each piece seemed to have its place, like a puzzle coming together. With guidance and a healthy dose of excitement, we pieced together our robot, eagerly anticipating the next phase.

## Unveiling the Power of mBlock IDE

To bring our mBot Neo to life, we delved into the mBlock Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provided by Makeblock, the creators of the mBot. What impressed us most was the IDE's versatility, offering two distinct coding approaches: block-based and Python. While we were comfortable with Python, we couldn't resist exploring the block-based option to truly understand the capabilities of the mBot.

## Exploring mBot's Potential

The initial coding experiments with the mBot Neo were nothing short of amazing. The blocks allowed us to command the robot's movements, giving us a taste of what this little technological marvel could achieve. As we watched it respond to our instructions, we couldn't help but feel a profound sense of accomplishment. The mBot Neo was not just a robot; it was becoming a canvas for our creativity and innovation.

## Pioneering the PID Path

In the midst of our mBot explorations, our mentor presented us with a unique challenge: creating a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) system to enable the robot to autonomously follow a wall using its ultrasonic sensors. While waiting for the Bluetooth dongle to arrive, this task was a brilliant way to engage our problem-solving skills and deepen our understanding of robotics.

## The Path Forward

As week two comes to a close, our connection with the mBot Neo grows stronger. We've witnessed its capabilities and begun to grasp the power of coding in shaping its actions. The prospect of creating a PID system adds an exciting layer to our learning journey. With the Bluetooth dongle on its way, we're eager to explore the realm of wireless communication and remote control.

Stay tuned as we continue to unravel the mysteries of robotics, discover the potential of the mBot Neo, and embrace the challenges that pave the way for our growth in the world of computer science and engineering.
