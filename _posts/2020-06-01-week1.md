Week 1: Setting Foot in Alabama

Arriving in Birmingham for my DREU program was a surreal experience. Just a few months ago, I had no idea what Tuscaloosa was, and now I find myself on my way there for an exciting summer adventure. As I stepped into the dorm, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it exceeded my expectations. It boasts a fully equipped kitchen with a fridge, freezer, dishwasher, and even a washer/dryer for your convenience. The best part? We had our own rooms and bathrooms, a luxury I hadn't anticipated. I felt incredibly welcomed by my mentor, who had arranged this amazing apartment for us.

A Campus that Inspires

The sprawling campus of the University of Alabama greeted me with open arms. The sheer size and beauty of the surroundings left a lasting impression. Unlike the hustle and bustle of the city, the area felt spacious and serene. I fell in love with the idea of the university being the focal point of everything in its vicinity. The whole area exuded a sense of safety and tranquility, making it an ideal place to pursue my research goals.

Embracing the Southern Heat

While the scorching temperatures of Tuscaloosa could be daunting for some, I found myself unfazed by the intense heat. The warmth was a constant reminder of the vibrant summer ahead, filled with opportunities for growth and discovery. Despite the sweltering weather, the enthusiasm bubbling within me overshadowed any discomfort.

Exploring the Campus and Beyond

Guided by the grad students, I embarked on a tour of the area. Even during the summer months, when the campus was relatively quiet, I could sense the vibrancy and activity that would accompany the school year. The well-constructed facilities left a lasting impression on me, showcasing the university's commitment to excellence. It was evident that this institution fostered an environment conducive to learning and innovation.

Unveiling the Research Lab

Stepping into the research lab was a moment of excitement and wonder. The lab was equipped with cutting-edge technology, which piqued my curiosity and fueled my anticipation for the projects ahead. One particular aspect that captured my interest was the brain drone race, a captivating field that I eagerly looked forward to engaging in.

Anticipation for the Journey Ahead

As the first week of my DREU program came to a close, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude and anticipation. Alabama welcomed me with open arms, and I was ready to immerse myself in research, the campus community, and the newfound opportunities that lay ahead. The stage was set for a summer of growth, collaboration, and unforgettable experiences.
