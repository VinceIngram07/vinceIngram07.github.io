Week 6 - Bridging Human and Robotic Interaction

As our DREU journey reached its sixth week, the fusion of human and robotic interaction emerged as the focal point of our exploration. The progress we had achieved so far was substantial - from mastering the autonomous capabilities of the mBot Neo to navigating open-source programming. Now, our sights were set on a semi-autonomous realm, where human physiological responses would guide the robot's actions.

## A New Horizon: Semi-Autonomous Control

The journey had led us to a pivotal junction: introducing a physical connection between human physiology and robotic control. With an EmotiBit in hand, we embarked on the ambitious endeavor of translating human physiological data into instructions for the mBot Neo. Our goal was to create a symbiotic relationship where the robot would respond to our physiological cues.

## Unraveling the EmotiBit Connection

Setting up the EmotiBit to capture and transmit physiological data was our first step. By harnessing Open Sound Control (OSC), we enabled the EmotiBit to relay information in real time. The challenge was translating this data from OSC to a format that could be utilized within Visual Studio Code (VSCode), where our robotic programming was centered.

## Navigating the Path of Trial and Error

As the week progressed, our work was a dance of trial and error. The road to success was paved with experimentation, meticulous coding, and relentless testing. Our goal was to bridge the gap between the human and robotic domains, using the EmotiBit as the conduit.

## Insights from Human Physiology

With each attempt, we delved deeper into the data provided by the EmotiBit. We used the PPG:RED data to explore physiological changes in response to human activities. Simple actions like performing pushups became a means of understanding the patterns and fluctuations in the physiological signals. Ultimately, we found that the EDA data offered the most consistent and usable insights.

## A New Dimension of Interaction

By the end of Week 6, the EmotiBit had transformed from a device into a bridge. A bridge connecting human emotions and physiological responses to the realm of robotics. The prospect of creating a semi-autonomous system, where the robot responds to our emotions and physical states, holds immense potential for future research and applications.

## The Road Ahead

Week 6 has reaffirmed our belief in the boundless possibilities that lie at the intersection of human interaction and robotics. The fusion of human physiology and technological innovation opens doors to exciting advancements. As we progress, we remain committed to the pursuit of knowledge, discovery, and the ever-evolving landscape of scientific exploration.

Stay tuned as we continue to bridge gaps, expand horizons, and pioneer new dimensions of interaction between humans and technology.
