title: Week 3 - Unraveling the Challenges of the PID System

In the third week of our DREU adventure, we found ourselves knee-deep in a realm of challenges and excitement. The goal was clear: make the mBot Neo follow a wall autonomously using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) system. While the task was daunting and unfamiliar, it proved to be a remarkable learning experience that pushed us to think creatively and problem-solve like never before.

## The Quest for Knowledge

At the outset, the concept of a PID system seemed like an enigma. None of us had prior experience with robotics or such intricate systems. Yet, research is about diving headfirst into the unknown. Our mentor provided invaluable guidance, sharing YouTube videos and dedicating time to explain PID systems through whiteboard illustrations. Slowly, the pieces began to fall into place.

## Crafting Creativity

As we embarked on the journey to make the mBot Neo follow the wall, creativity became our greatest ally. Our brainstorming sessions often led us down unexpected paths. One such creative twist was relocating the ultrasonic sensor from the front to the side of the mBot. Affixing it in place with a simple piece of tape might have seemed unconventional, but it was a testament to our innovative spirit.

## Trials, Errors, and Triumphs

Challenges and setbacks were inevitable companions on this quest. Trial and error became our method of choice, guiding us through multiple iterations. Our mBot Neo wiggled and veered off track in its initial attempts to follow the wall. It was both frustrating and exhilarating to witness the robot's struggle for perfection. Each deviation was a step closer to refining our PID system.

## Cracking the Code

After days of relentless efforts, the moment of triumph arrived. The mBot Neo, with its ultrasonic sensor positioned on the side and our carefully tweaked PID system in place, started to follow the wall with a newfound grace. The wiggles began to diminish as the robot's algorithmic brain learned to correct its course. We had cracked the code, not just in terms of programming, but also in terms of resilience and determination.

## The Path Ahead

As we reflect on Week 3, we realize that research is a journey of persistence and creativity. The challenges we encountered fortified our problem-solving skills and ignited our passion for robotics and automation. With our PID system operational, the road ahead holds promises of further optimization and exploration.

Stay tuned as we continue to unravel the mysteries of robotics, refine our systems, and venture deeper into the realms of innovation and scientific discovery.
